# Description

Unseeable is a game that takes place from the perspective of a person who is colorblind. It was developed in a custom engine with the intention of teaching those with normal color vision what itâ€™s like to not only see the world as a colorblind person does, but to also help them gain a better understanding of the struggles that this visual impairment causes. To do this, the game takes you through real life situations that are easy for those without colorblindness, but are difficult and nearly impossible for those who have it.
